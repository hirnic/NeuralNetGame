To-do list:
1. Loading screen, round time remaining label.
2. More types of neural networks. More components to purchase (batch size, loss fuunctions, training data ("memory"), node_values, ...). More advanced options.
3. Fix the skibbidy segments of code. For example, why use all those labels for the nodes (in build_screen function) when it can be done with one label?
4. Clean and comment the code.
5. More pretty colors.
6. Tutorial.
