To-do list:
1. Show neural net performance for each round.
2. More types of neural networks. More components to purchase (batch size, loss fuunctions, training data ("memory"), node_values, ...). More advanced options.
3. Fix the skibbidy segments of code. For example, why use all those labels for the nodes (in build_screen function) when it can be done with one label?
4. Clean and comment the code.
5. More pretty colors.
6. Tutorial.

To get this running, you need main, GUI_V3, Game_Logic, Shop_Logic, and Brain_V2
